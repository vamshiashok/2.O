SQL
------------------------
SQL -> Structured Query Language
PL/SQL -> Procedural Language or Structured Query Language

Database -> A place where we are storing our data.

Before the database the information is stored in files, but the main 
  drawback of storing the information in files is there is no security for the files.

Different Database's 
-----------
->Oracle -> it is a software which manages the database.
->MySQL
->SQL Server
->PostgreSQL
->RDS
->DB2

SQL -> It is a language which is used to interact with the database.
The user can interact with the database like oracle using SQL Language.

NoSQL Database -> No Structured Query Language. It can handle large amount of data.

stores info in the form of 
a) key-value pairs
b) Graph
c) Document Oriented
d) Wide Column

Examples of NoSQL DB's
1) MongoDB
2) Cassandra

SQL database stores/performs operations on strucured data.
NoSQL performs on unstructured data.

Structured -> Clear organization of data (Ex: Table format)
Unstructured -> Data in the form of image, video or audio...

Types of Database's 
----------------------
1) OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) [used for day to day transactions]
2) OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) [Daily analysis of the organization]

Centralized DB
Distributed DB
Cloud DB
Hierarchical DB
Relational DB **********IMP*****

Relational Database 
---------------------
The data/information is organized in the form of tables.

Table 
----------
Row -> Record -> Tuple (The entire info)
Column -> Fields -> Domain -> Attribute

RDBMS has ACID Properties thats why RDBMS is popular

A -> Atomicity 
C -> Consistency
I -> Isolation
D -> Durability

Atomicity (Consider a transcation that it is either successful or not at all started)
          (If user A send 500Rs to User B either it will be credit to the User B or don't debit from the user A)

Consistency (Before and After transactions update the account balance simply called standards)

Isolation (Only one suppose more than one user wants to withdraw money from the one account it is not possible)

Durability (once all operations are completed you must commit the data)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DBMS : It is a software which is used to create and manage the database.
        It is a interface b/w user and database.

RDBMS: The data which stored in the form of tables. The software which is uses the relations database.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Day 2
-------------------------------------------------------------
MySQL:

Syntax:
------------
The Query/statement always begin with the command.

Data types:
----------------
The type of information that we are storing.
MySQL Datatypes:
1) Numeric
2) String
3) Date
Numeric: 
--------------
a) Integer (A number which has no decimal point)
b) Float (Which is used to store real number with single precision)
c) Double (Which is used to store real number with double precision)
d) decimal(a,b)
    Ex: decimal(5,2) 5 -> Precision & 2 -> Scale
    243.42 
e) bit(size) (It is used to store binary values consists of 8 bits)
String: 
-----------------
a)char(n) (It store a fixed length string)
b)varchar(n) (It's a variable length string) if we use varchar you can modify the size of datatype.
c)text (There is no limit for size)
d)blob (To store images)

Date:
---------------
a)date (It gives the YY-MM-DD)
b)time (HH-MM-SS)
c)datetime (combination of above two)
d)timestamp (Exact time with date)

SQL is Not Case Sensitive, you can use INT or int , normally we use upper case for predefined keywords.

Different Language of commands:
-------------------------------------
1)DDL(Data Definition Language)
  -> create
  -> drop
  -> truncate
  -> rename
  -> alter
2)DML(Data Manipulation Language)
  -> insert 
  -> update
  -> delete
3)DQL/DRL(Data Query/Retrieval Language) **IMP**
  -> select
4)TCL(Transaction Control Language)
  -> commit
  -> rollback
  -> save point
5)DCL(Data Control Language) ***IMP at Admin Level***
  -> grant
  -> revoke

Creating Database
-------------------
>> create database krish;
>> create database college;

To list out the DB's
----------------------
>> show databases;

In which DB we have to store the data, we must specify it as
>> use krish/college;

Creating a table in the college DB:
-----------------------------------
Sytax:
>> create table table_name(col1 dt1,col2 dt2,....coln dtn);
Ex:
>> create table student(S_ID int,name varchar(30),branch varchar(10),age float,DOB date);

To describe the table format:
-------------------------------
>> DESC student;
It return the col name followed by the datatype.
